match1
======

Usage
-----

    match1(x, table, incomparables=NULL)

Details
-------

Similar to `match`, but
`x` and `table` must be single values,
`nomatch` is effectively fixed at `FALSE`, and
the return is a `logical` vector of length 1,
indicating whether there was a match.

Example
-------

    # (See documentation for `b.match1All`)
