History
-------

The [first val protopackage](../../5/0) was developed in support
of a system to compare observation data and simulation results
(time series) that are stored together in a single `data.frame`.

 Verification vs. Validation
---------------------------

PJ Roache, author of _Computational Fluid Dynamics_ and other works,
distinguishes the two.
Verification is "solving the equations right,"
whereas validation is "solving the right equations."
The former can be accomplished with mathematical rigor.
The latter must be assessed via comparrison with emperical data.
