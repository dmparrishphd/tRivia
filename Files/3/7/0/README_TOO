This collection of files is a protopackage (see also ./INSTALL).

The _ATTACH.R file in the R subdirectory contains code to load
and attach this proto package. To use, Replace

    path

(the letters _within_ the double quotes) in the SNIPPET below
with the path to the install directory (see ./INSTALL) do _not_
include a trailing solidus or slash (/) in the replacement text.

    # SNIPPET:
    DIR <- "path"
    FILENAME <- paste0 ( DIR , "/R/_ATTACH.R" )
    source ( FILENAME ) [[ 1 ]] ( DIR )

For example, if this package is stored at "~/DIRECTORY",
the RESULTANT SNIPPET would be

    # RESULTANT SNIPPET:
    DIR <- "~/DIRECTORY"
    FILENAME <- paste0 ( DIR , "/R/_ATTACH.R" )
    source ( FILENAME ) [[ 1 ]] ( DIR )
