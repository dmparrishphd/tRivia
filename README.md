# tRivia
tRivia is a family of R packages (and **protopackages**) providing functions and values that are trivial when taken by themselves, but which may be combined to form interesting components. By **protopackage**, I mean a file that is intended to be loaded with `source` (as opposed to `library`) and does not need to be installed in the manner libraries are installed.

The .tar.gz files are R packages. The R files are reproduced from the packages for ease of code browsing.

Each package is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.
