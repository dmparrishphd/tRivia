# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages and
[*protopackages*](./Files/3/0/protopackages.md)
that
provide trivial components.
The components may be combined in non-trivial ways.
Most components are functions.

Each
[component](./Files/7/0/index.md)
is designed to have no dependencies except the basic packages
(`base`, `Autoloads`, `methods`, `datasets`, `utils`, `grDevices`, `graphics`, and `stats`).

Find components by browsing the
[Files](./Files)
or searching the
[Directory](./Files/1/3/0/directory.md).
