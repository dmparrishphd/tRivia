# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages (and
[*protopackages*](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/tRivia/blob/master/Files/3/0/protopackages.md))
providing functions and values that are trivial when taken by themselves, but which may be combined to form interesting components.

Each package or protopackage is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.

The .tar.gz files are R packages. The R files are reproduced from the packages for ease of code browsing.
