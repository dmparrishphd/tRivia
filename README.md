# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages (and
[*protopackages*](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/tRivia/blob/master/Files/3/0/protopackages.md))
providing functions and values that are trivial when taken by themselves, but which may be combined to form interesting components.

Each
[package or protopackage](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/tRivia/blob/master/Files/7/0/index.md)
is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.
