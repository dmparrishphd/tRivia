# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages and
[*protopackages*](./Files/3/0/protopackages.md)

provide trivial components.
The components may be combined in non-trivial ways.
Most components are functions.

Each component
[package or protopackage](./Files/7/0/index.md)
is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.

Find components by browsing the
[Files](./Files)
or searching the
[Directory](./Files/1/3/0/directory.md).
