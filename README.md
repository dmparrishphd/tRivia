# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages (and
[*protopackages*](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/tRivia/blob/master/Files/3/0/protopackages.md))
providing components (mostly functions and values) that are trivial when taken by themselves, but
which may be combined in interesting ways.

Each
[package or protopackage](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/tRivia/blob/master/Files/7/0/index.md)
is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.

Find components by browsing the
[Files](./Files)
or searching the
[Directory](./Files/1/3/0/list.md).
