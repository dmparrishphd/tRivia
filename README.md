# tRivia
_tRivia_ is a family of R packages (and *protopackages*) providing functions and values that are trivial when taken by themselves, but which may be combined to form interesting components.

Each package or protopackage is designed to have no dependencies except `base`.

## Packages

The .tar.gz files are R packages. The R files are reproduced from the packages for ease of code browsing.

## Protopackages

By *protopackage*, I mean a file that is intended to be loaded with `source` (as opposed to `library`) and does _not_ need to be installed (as in `install.packages`).
